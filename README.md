# "Exploratory Analysis on Diabetes Dataset"

# Introduction
This project focuses on exploring a diabetes dataset to understand patterns and factors associated with diabetes. The dataset includes various features such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, SkinThickness,Insuline,BloodPressure,Age and others that contribute to assessing diabetes risk.
# Objectives
## 1.Analyze relationships between various features and diabetes outcomes.
## 2.Identify significant predictors of diabetes.
## 3.Visualize data to highlight trends and distributions.
# Dataset
## The dataset contains columns such as:
#### 1.Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
#### 2.Glucose: Glucose concentration.
#### 3.Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
#### 4.Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
#### 5.Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
#### 6.BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
#### 7.Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
#### 8.Age: Age of the individual.
#### 9.Outcome: Diabetes diagnosis (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes).
