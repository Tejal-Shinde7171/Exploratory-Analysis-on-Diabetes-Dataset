# "Exploratory Analysis on Diabetes Dataset"
# Introduction
This project focuses on exploring a diabetes dataset to understand patterns and factors associated with diabetes. The dataset includes various features such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, SkinThickness,Insuline,BloodPressure,Age and others that contribute to assessing diabetes risk.

# Objectives
#####  1.Analyze relationships between various features and diabetes outcomes.
#####  2.Identify significant predictors of diabetes.
#####  3.Visualize data to highlight trends and distributions.

# Dataset
## The dataset contains columns such as:
##### 1.Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
##### 2.Glucose: Glucose concentration.
##### 3.Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
##### 4.Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
##### 5.Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
##### 6.BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
##### 7.Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
##### 8.Age: Age of the individual.
##### 9.Outcome: Diabetes diagnosis (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes).

# Methodology
#### In summary, the methodologies applied in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a diabetes dataset include:
##### 1.Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and managing outliers in variables like Glucose, Blood Pressure, and BMI.
##### 2.Statistical Analysis: Computing descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.) and exploring correlations between variables (e.g., Glucose and BMI).
##### 3.Data Visualization: Creating visual representations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand data distributions and relationships.
##### 4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, trends, and potential insights related to diabetes risk factors within the dataset.
##### 5.Documentation and Reporting: Summarizing findings, formulating hypotheses, and providing recommendations based on the analysis.
###### These methods collectively help in understanding the dataset, revealing relationships between variables, and deriving insights into factors influencing diabetes outcomes.
