# "Exploratory Analysis on Diabetes Dataset"
# Introduction
This project focuses on exploring a diabetes dataset to understand patterns and factors associated with diabetes. The dataset includes various features such as Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, SkinThickness,Insuline,BloodPressure,Age and others that contribute to assessing diabetes risk.

# Objectives
#####  1.Analyze relationships between various features and diabetes outcomes.
#####  2.Identify significant predictors of diabetes.
#####  3.Visualize data to highlight trends and distributions.

# Dataset
## The dataset contains columns such as:
##### 1.Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies.
##### 2.Glucose: Glucose concentration.
##### 3.Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure.
##### 4.Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm).
##### 5.Insulin: 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
##### 6.BMI: Body Mass Index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
##### 7.Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
##### 8.Age: Age of the individual.
##### 9.Outcome: Diabetes diagnosis (0 = no diabetes, 1 = diabetes).

# Methodology
#### In summary, the methodologies applied in an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a diabetes dataset include:
##### 1.Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and managing outliers in variables like Glucose, Blood Pressure, and BMI.
##### 2.Statistical Analysis: Computing descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.) and exploring correlations between variables (e.g., Glucose and BMI).
##### 3.Data Visualization: Creating visual representations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to understand data distributions and relationships.
##### 4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns, trends, and potential insights related to diabetes risk factors within the dataset.
##### 5.Documentation and Reporting: Summarizing findings, formulating hypotheses, and providing recommendations based on the analysis.
###### These methods collectively help in understanding the dataset, revealing relationships between variables, and deriving insights into factors influencing diabetes outcomes.
# TYPES OF DIABETIC:  
### The most commonly three types of the Type1 Diabetes,Type2 Diabetes and Gestational Diabetes.
## 1.Type1 Diabetes:
   #### a. If you type 1 Diabetes,your body does not make insuline.
   #### b. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancrease that make insuline.
   #### c. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults,although it can appear at any age.
   #### d. People with type 1 diabetes need to be take insuline every day to stay alive.
   #### e. Type 1 diabetes is found in high numbers in Northern Europe, as well  as in countries in the Middle East and Asia.
   #### f. Type 1 diabetes makes up an estimated 5â€“10% of all diabetes cases.
   #### g.Although it is estimated that about 80,000 children develop the disease each year.
   #### h.Type 1 Diabetes are found in a children aged 4-10 and 14-16 years.
## Sigficant of the Type1 Diabetes:
   #### a.Eye Problem
   #### b.Foot problem
   #### c.Heart Disease
   #### d.Fast breathing
   #### e.Behavior changes
   #### f.Fruity-smelling breath
## Precautions Of Type 1 Diabetes:
   #### a.Eat a healthy food
   #### b.Dont Smoke
   #### c.Pay attention to your feet
   #### d. Manage your blood sugar
## 2.Type 2 Diabetes:
   #### a. If you have a type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insuline.
   #### b. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age ,even during childhood.
   #### c. However,this type2 of diabetes occurs most often in middle age and older age people.
   #### d. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes.
   #### e.Researchers estimate that Type 2Diabetes affects about 6.3% of the world's population.
## Sigficant of Type 2 Diabetes:
   #### a. Dry Skin
   #### b. Unexpected weight loss
   #### c.Blurred vision.
## Precautions of Type 2 Diabetes:
   #### a. reachi and keep a healthy body weight.
   #### b. Stay phisically active with atleast 30 minutes of moderate exercises each day.
   #### c. not smoke Tabacco
## 3.Gestational Diabetes:
  #### a. Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregent.
  #### b. Most of the time,this type of diabetes goes away after the baby is born.
  #### c. However ,if youve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
  #### d. Sometimes,diabetes diagnosed during pregency is actually type 2 diabetes.
